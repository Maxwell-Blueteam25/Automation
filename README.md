# ⚙️ Automation Scripts Repository

Welcome to my **Automation** scripts repository — a curated collection of tools and scripts designed to optimize security operations (SecOps), incident response (IR), and IT support workflows through automation.

---

## Why This Matters

In fast-paced IT and security environments, automation is critical to:  
- Accelerate threat detection and response  
- Streamline user and system management  
- Reduce human error and improve reliability  
- Scale operations efficiently without sacrificing control

These scripts demonstrate my ability to automate complex tasks, integrate cloud and on-prem resources, and support business continuity.

## Current Structure

- **powershell/**  
  A growing library of PowerShell scripts tailored for Windows system administration, Azure/Azure Entra ID automation, and security tooling.

*Future updates will include scripts in other languages such as Python and Bash to extend capabilities across platforms and environments.*

---

## What You’ll Find Here

- **Security Operations Automation**: Tasks like automated user provisioning, log parsing, alert triage, and vulnerability scanning.  
- **Incident Response Helpers**: Scripts for forensic data collection, system snapshots, and network analysis.  
- **IT Support & Systems Management**: Automated onboarding/offboarding, configuration management, and patching.  

Each script is built with modularity, error handling, and maintainability in mind — ready to be adapted or expanded as operational needs evolve.

## How to Use

Dive into the subfolders for detailed instructions, prerequisites, and sample usage. Scripts can be run locally or integrated into cloud automation platforms like Azure Automation or CI/CD pipelines.

---

## What’s Next

- Expanding language support beyond PowerShell to include Python and Bash  
- Adding real-time alerting and remediation workflows  
- Incorporating integration with SIEMs and ticketing systems  
- Enhancing documentation and test coverage  

---

## Let’s Connect

I’m eager to bring these automation skills into a SecOps, DFIR, or IT Technician role to help teams move faster, safer, and smarter.

*Please test scripts carefully in a safe environment before deploying to production.*
